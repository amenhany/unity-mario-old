# Mario Game Demo üçÑ

This game demo, solo developed using the Unity Game Engine, was made entirely from scratch. It tries to mimic Super Mario World with some elements from other Mario games and physics from Celeste. It includes a very easy level editor, with various tiles, collision boxes, parallax background, and more!

## Features üí•
- Lives and Respawning
- 1-UP Mushrooms which moves until it bounces off a wall
- Mushroom which moves until it bounces off a wall(Big Mario)
- Fireflower which is static (Fire Mario)
- Goombas (can be stomped on which boosts your jump)
- Coins (100 coins give an extra life)
- Various Animations (Idle, Walk, Sprint, Jump, Fall, Crouch, Death, for each mario type, Goomba Walk and Squash, Spinning Coin)
- Complete Music and Sound Effects
- Working Pipe System which transitions to a different part of the level, changes music, etc
- Smooth Jumping Mechanics (jumping can activate briefly after exiting a platform, holding down jump button increases jump height, hitting the corner of a ceiling doesn't halt the entire jump, and more)
